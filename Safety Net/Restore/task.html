<h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Now that your main codebase is stable, let's focus on another essential task in collaborative software development: restoring files to a previous state. This is a common scenario when unwanted or incorrect changes have been introduced into a codebase. You may often need to revert specific files or entire sections of a project back to a known, stable version. This ability to "undo" changes is crucial in maintaining code quality and stability, especially when working with multiple collaborators on a shared repository.</p><p>Your colleagues have accidentally introduced unrequested features into the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch. Your task is to help them by restoring the <code class="java">case_operations.py</code> file to a previous commit and committing the changes with a clear and descriptive message.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>Let's break this task into clear steps:</p><ul><li><p>Switch to the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch: create a local copy of <code class="java">feature/case</code> from the remote repository.</p></li><li><p>Restore <code class="java">case_operations.py</code> to a previous state: using the commit <code class="java">6b2ec72</code>, restore the file <code class="java">case_operations.py</code> to its state from that commit. This will undo changes that were made from that point.</p></li><li><p>Commit the changes: after restoring the file, stage and commit the changes with the following commit message: <code class="java">refactor: restored case operations from 6b2ec72</code>.</p></li><li><p>Verify the branch: ensure that the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch contains the correct number of commits and that the restored file matches the content from the <code class="java">6b2ec72</code> commit.</p></li></ul>
