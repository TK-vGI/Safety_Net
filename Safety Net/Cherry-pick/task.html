<h5 id="description"> Description</h5><p>Typically, features are merged into development branches rather than directly into the main branch. This branch is reserved for production-ready code. Since <code class="language-shell">feature/math</code> was designated a feature branch, we should have merged it into the <code class="language-shell">0.2.x-dev</code> development branch instead of the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch.</p><p>In this stage, you will correct this mistake.  You will use Git's <code class="language-shell">cherry-pick</code> command to transfer the necessary commit from <code class="language-shell">main</code> to <code class="language-shell">0.2.x-dev</code> and then reset the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch to its original state, ensuring that only the initial commit remains. This is a common task in real-world projects when managing multiple branches. </p><p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">When you reset the main branch, only the <code class="language-shell">feat: Initial</code> commit should remain.</div><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>Let's break this task into a few steps:</p><ul><li><p>Switch to the <code class="language-shell">0.2.x-dev</code> branch: this is your development branch, where new features should be integrated. Ensure that you are working from this branch before proceeding;</p></li><li><p>Cherry-pick the last commit from the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch:  use the appropriate command to transfer the most recent commit from <code class="language-shell">main</code> to <code class="language-shell">0.2.x-dev</code>. This will allow the feature to be correctly integrated into the development branch.</p></li><li><p>After cherry-picking the commit, return to the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch to prepare for the reset;</p></li><li><p>Reset the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch to its original state:  reset the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch to the state it was in before the last merge, leaving only the initial commit (<code class="language-shell">feat: Initial</code>).</p></li></ul><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p>Example 1: Resetting the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch to its original state:  </p><pre><code class="language-shell">$ git &lt;command&gt;
HEAD is now at abc123 feat: Initial</code></pre><p>Example 2: Verifying the commit history in the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">$ git log --oneline
