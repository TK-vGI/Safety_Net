<h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>In modern software development, managing code versions, collaborating with others, and keeping track of changes is essential. Git, a widely used version control system, allows developers to do just that. In this stage, you will start by setting up a local copy of a remote Git repository. This is a common first step when joining a new project or contributing to an existing one. You will clone a repository, fetch all remote branches, switch to a specific development branch, and verify that all the needed branches are available.</p><p>By completing this stage, you will have a local repository synchronized with the remote repository. This way, you will ensure you are working with the latest code and on the correct branch. These steps are critical in real-world projects where multiple developers collaborate and work on different branches simultaneously.</p><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>You may corrupt the repository while working on this project. It may be helpful to understand the status of the repository and branches. The commands <code class="java">git branch --all</code> and <code class="java">git log --oneline</code> can help you view branches and the commit history.  If you want to start over, you can clone the repository again.</p></div><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>Let's break this task into steps:</p><ul><li><p>Open a terminal and clone the remote Git repository to your local machine at the project root. This will create a local copy of the remote repository. You can use either SSH or HTTPS:</p><ul><li><p>For SSH: <code class="java">git@github.com:hyperskill-content/Safety-net-study-repository.git</code></p></li><li><p>For HTTPS: <code class="java">https://github.com/hyperskill-content/Safety-net-study-repository.git</code></p></li></ul><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>If you get a <strong>Permission denied</strong> error when cloning with SSH, try using HTTPS instead.</p></div></li><li><p>After cloning, move into the newly created repository directory to work with the project files.</p></li><li><p>Switch to the development branch <code class="java">0.2.x-dev</code> to work on the latest development code.  Ensure you create a local copy from the remote.</p></li><li><p>List all available branches in your local repository to confirm that the correct branches are present.</p></li></ul>
