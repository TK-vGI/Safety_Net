<h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>In collaborative software development, completing a feature is only part of the process. Once the feature is ready, it must be integrated into the main development branch to ensure that all team members can access the updated code. Merging feature branches into the development branch is a common practice that helps maintain a clean, organized repository while ensuring that the latest features are available for further testing and development.</p><p>In this stage, you will finalize your work on the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch by merging it into the <code class="java">0.2.x-dev</code> development branch. After merging, the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch will no longer be needed, so you will delete it to keep the repository clean. Finally, you will verify that the merge was successful and that the repository is in the correct state.</p><p>This process mirrors real-world software development, where teams frequently merge feature branches into development branches to integrate new code while maintaining a clean, streamlined repository.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>To complete this stage, you need to follow these steps:</p><ul><li><p>Rebase the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch with <code class="java">0.2.x-dev</code>: before merging, rebase the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch with the <code class="java">0.2.x-dev</code> branch to ensure that it includes the latest changes from the development branch. This is necessary to avoid conflicts and ensure that the feature branch is up to date.</p></li><li><p>Switch to the <code class="java">0.2.x-dev</code> branch: after rebasing, switch to the <code class="java">0.2.x-dev</code> branch. This is the development branch where the latest features are integrated.</p></li><li><p>Merge the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch into <code class="java">0.2.x-dev</code>: perform the merge operation to integrate the changes from the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch into the <code class="java">0.2.x-dev</code> branch. This will bring the new feature into the development branch without creating a separate merge commit.</p></li><li><p>Delete the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch: once the merge is complete, delete the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch. This helps keep the repository clean by removing branches that are no longer needed.</p></li><li><p>Verify the repository state: ensure that the <code class="java">0.2.x-dev</code> branch now contains the commits from the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch and that the <code class="java">feature/case</code> branch has been successfully deleted.</p></li></ul>
