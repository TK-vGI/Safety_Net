<div class="step-text">
<h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Congratulations on successfully developing your feature in the <code class="language-shell">feature/math</code> branch! Since your new feature has passed all tests and reviews, it's time to show the world what you've been working on. In this stage, you will integrate your new feature into the main codebase.</p><p>Because the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch hasn't been modified since you branched off, the merge will be a <strong>fast-forward</strong> merge. This type of merge simply moves the branch pointer forward to include the new commits without creating a merge commit. Once the merge is complete, you'll clean up by deleting the <code class="language-shell">feature/math</code> branch, as it's no longer needed.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>Let's break this task into a few steps:</p><ul><li><p>Switch to the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch. This is the branch where the production-ready version of the project is stored.</p></li><li><p>Merge <code class="language-shell">feature/math</code> into the <code class="language-shell">main.</code> This will integrate the new file containing the new feature into the main codebase.</p></li><li><p>Delete the <code class="language-shell">feature/math</code> branch as it's no longer needed. This helps keep the repository clean and avoids clutter from unused branches.</p></li></ul><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p>Example 1: Merging the <code class="language-shell">feature/math</code> branch into the <code class="language-shell">main</code> branch:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">$ git &lt;command&gt;
